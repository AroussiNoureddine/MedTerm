Please answer the below core-java Questions:

What is programing language?
A programming language is a special language programmers use to develop software programs, scripts, or other sets of instructions for computers to execute



What jdk contains or composed of and define each components?
The JDK is a software package that contains a variety of tools and utilities that make it possible to develop, package, monitor and deploy applications that build for any standard Java platform, including Java Platform, Standard Edition (Java SE); Java Platform, Micro Edition (Java ME); and Java Platform, Enterprise Edition

    javac: This utility is used to compile Java source code into Java bytecode.
  rmic: This utility creates skeletons and stubs for use in Remote Method Invocation (RMI).
  jar: This compression utility aggregates a multitude of files into a single Java ARchive (JAR) file. The jar utility uses a standard compression algorithm used by all of the most common zip utilities.
  javadoc: This utility can examine the names of classes and the methods contained within a class, as well as consume special annotations in order to create application programming interface (API) documentation for Java code.
  wsgen: This generates various artifacts required by Java API for XML Web Services (JAX-WS).
  javap: This utility disassembles class files, generating information about the methods, properties and attributes of a given compiled component.





What is IDE?
A.integrated development environment

What are the IDEs available in the market to support java?
Eclipce
intellij
netbeans

Explain the entire java life cycle.
editor to source code then compiler it to bytecodes then JVM then OS

what is class?
a class is a blueprint from which objects are made

What is object?
an Object is an  instances of a class

What is the entry point of an application?
the Main Method;

Why main is static?
Main method in Java is entry point for any core Java program
main() is called by the JVM before any objects are made. Since it is static it can be directly invoked via the class

Which class is the superclass of all classes?
java.lang

What is difference between path and classpath variables?
Path is an environment variable which is used by the operating system to find the executables. Classpath is an environment variable which is used by the Java compiler to find the path, of classes.

What is the difference between an Interface and Abstract class?
An interface is an empty shell. There are only the signatures of the methods, which implies that the methods do not have a body. The interface can't do anything. It's just a pattern.
Abstract classes, unlike interfaces, are classes. They are more expensive to use, because there is a look-up to do when you inherit from them.

Can you make an Object from an Interface and Abstract class ? if not how do you use it ?
no you can't

what is Access Specifier?
An access specifier is a defining code element that can determine which elements of a program are allowed to access a specific variable or other piece of data.

What is OOP ? Define each feature of java OOP.
Object Oriented Programming
encapsulation is nothing more than combining data and behavior in one package and hiding the implementation details from the user of the object. The data in an object are called its instance fields, and the procedures that operate on the data are called its methods
Abstraction main goal is to handle complexity by hiding unnecessary details from the user
inheritance It is the mechanism in java by which one class is allow to inherit the features(fields and methods) of another class
Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms.

What is Java Package and which package is imported by default?
Package in Java is a mechanism to encapsulate a group of classes, sub packages and interfaces
java.lang

What is API? Name list of API that you have used so far.
application programming interface.
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/

Does java support multiple inheritance, explain why or why not?
no it does not
for class to inherite  from multiple  superclass does not work for java.

What is method overloading and when it happens?
Overloading occurs when two or more methods in one class have the same method name but different parameters.
the overloading happens during compile time

Explain exceptions in java and how to handle it.
Exceptions are events that occur during the execution of programs that disrupt the normal flow of instructions
Java exception handling is managed via five keywords: try, catch, throw, throws and finally

What is static keyword in java? How it has been used in variables and methods ?
The static keyword in Java is used for memory management mainly. We can apply java static keyword with variables, methods, blocks and nested class. The static keyword belongs to the class than an instance of the class.

What is final and how it has been used variables and methods?
final variables its value can’t be modified, essentially, a constant
A final method cannot be overridden.
 A final class cannot be extended(inherited)

What is final, finally and finalize?
1)	Final is used to apply restrictions on class, method and variable. Final class can't be inherited, final method can't be overridden and final variable value can't be changed.	Final is a keyword.
2) Finally is used to place important code, it will be executed whether exception is handled or not. Finally is a block.
3)Finalize is used to perform clean up processing just before object is garbage collected. Finalize is a method.

What is a constructor ?
A constructor in Java is a block of code similar to a method that's called when an instance of an object is created
Can we have multiple constructors in a class?
yes we can.

If we don't have a constructor declared, what is called during the object creation?
the default constructor.

What is "this" keyword in java ?
it refer to the variable declared in the class not the method.

What is "super" keyword in java? How many possible way can you use?
super refer to the super class the current class is extends to
we can use the super constructor.

What is JVM stand for ?
java virtual machine

Is JVM platform independent?
no its not

What version of java are you using?
1.8

What is JAR stand for ?
java Archive.

What is the difference between JDK and JVM?
jdk have Development Tools(to provide an environment to develop your java programs)
jvm is part of jdk and it execute the source code line by line ;

What is the difference between JVM and JRE?
jvm is part of jdk and it execute the source code line by line ;
 JRE (to execute your java program).

What is compile time and run time?
compile time is the time it tale to compile the source code.
When a program is running, or executing, it is said to be in runtime.

What is heap?
The heap is the runtime data area from which memory for all class instances and arrays is allocated.

How java manage it's memory?
Generally, memory is divided into two big parts: the stack and the heap. Please keep in mind that the size of memory types in this picture are not proportional to the memory size in reality. The heap is a huge amount of memory compared to the stack.

What is the difference between String, StringBuffer and StringBuilder?
String is immutable object. String is stored in the Constant String Pool
StringBuffer is mutable means one can change the value of the object . The object created through StringBuffer is stored in the heap
StringBuilder is same as the StringBuffer , that is it stores the object in heap and it can also be modified . The main difference between the StringBuffer and StringBuilder is that StringBuilder is also not thread safe. StringBuilder is fast as it is not thread safe .

What is Singleton class?
In object-oriented programming, a singleton class is a class that can have only one object (an instance of the class) at a time.

What is Serialization and Deserialization?
Serialization is a mechanism of converting the state of an object into a byte stream. Deserialization is the reverse process where the byte stream is used to recreate the actual Java object in memory

The Java transient keyword is used on class attributes/variables to indicate that serialization process of such class should ignore such variables while creating a persistent byte stream for any instance of that class.

Difference between while and do..while loop?
The do while loop executes the content of the loop once before checking the condition of the while.
Whereas a while loop will check the condition first before executing the content.

What is Enum?
A Java Enum is a special Java type used to define collections of constants. More precisely, a Java enum type is a special kind of Java class. An enum can contain constants, methods etc

What is Iterator?
Iterators are used in Collection framework in Java to retrieve elements one by one

Which one will take more memory, an int or Integer?
Integer

Why is String Immutable in Java?
The string is Immutable in Java because String objects are cached in String pool. Since cached String literals are shared between multiple clients there is always a risk, where one client's action would affect all another client

What is constructor chaining in Java?
Constructor chaining is the process of calling one constructor from another constructor with respect to current object.

The difference between Serial and Parallel Garbage Collector?
a serial collector is a default copying collector which uses only one GC thread for the GC operation, while a parallel collector uses multiple GC threads for the GC operation.

What is JIT stands for?
Just In time

Explain Java Heap space and Garbage collection?
Java Heap space is used by java runtime to allocate memory to Objects and JRE classes. Whenever we create any object, it’s always created in the Heap space.
Garbage Collection runs on the heap memory to free the memory used by objects that doesn’t have any reference. Any object created in the heap space has global access and can be referenced from anywhere of the application.

Can you guarantee the garbage collection process?
Java garbage collection is an automatic process.

What is the difference between stack and heap in Java?
Java Heap space is used by java runtime to allocate memory to Objects and JRE classes. Whenever we create any object, it’s always created in the Heap space.
Java Stack memory is used for execution of a thread. They contain method specific values that are short-lived and references to other objects in the heap that are getting referred from the method.

What is reflection in java and why is it useful?
Reflection is an API which is used to examine or modify the behavior of methods, classes, interfaces at runtime.

what is multithreading in java?
Multithreading is a Java feature that allows concurrent execution of two or more parts of a program for maximum utilization of CPU. Each part of such program is called a thread. So, threads are light-weight processes within a process.

What is the use of synchronization in Java?
Synchronization in Java is an important concept since Java is a multi-threaded language where multiple threads run in parallel to complete program execution. In multi-threaded environment synchronization of Java object or synchronization of Java class becomes extremely important. Synchronization in Java is possible by using Java keywords "synchronized" and "volatile”.

What is Framework?
Frameworks are large bodies (usually many classes) of prewritten code to which you add your own code to solve a problem in a specific domain

What are the testing Framework available in java?
testNG & jUnit

Difference between jUnit and testNG?
JUnit
JUnit is an open-source unit testing framework for a test-driven development environment. It supports the core concept of “first testing then coding”. This framework is specifically designed for Java programming language. In this, data is first tested and then it is inserted in the piece of code. It provides the simplest approach for writing code swiftly and easily.  It also offers annotation for test method identification.

TestNG
TestNG is an open-source automation testing framework specifically designed for Java Programming language. TestNG resembles JUnit and NUnit but offers some new functionality to make it powerful and easier to use. TestNG supports concurrent testing and offers annotation support as well. TestNG has a powerful execution model with flexible test configuration capabilities.

What are the dependencies for this project?
the java.util
the JDBC drivers
the jUnit and TestiNG
jasonx

what is dependency injection in java?
Dependency injection is a concept valid for any programming language. The general concept behind dependency injection is called Inversion of Control. According to this concept a class should not configure its dependencies statically but should be configured from the outside.

What is static binding and dynamic binding?
Dynamic Binding: In Dynamic binding compiler doesn’t decide the method to be called. Overriding is a perfect example of dynamic binding.
Static Binding: The binding which can be resolved at compile time by compiler is known as static or early binding. Binding of all the static, private and final methods is done at compile-time .
